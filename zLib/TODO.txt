CONFIGURATIONS
- download gmock & gtest at cmake step. or find a better alternative (problem building zLib separately)
- git submodules - is everything ok?
- rc files on windows - version
- ssh files on linux machine
- cpack / make install
- CMake files do not currently know about Windows or Linux files.
- We "export" classes that use "std::string" and other dynamically-linked components.
- should "zLib" contain zSearch and other zLib projects, or vice-versa?

CODE
- create directory of full path (not only name)
- create directory paths
- invalid paths + \\?\ -- shoule we consider?
- paths: change / to \\ or vice versa
- #define THROW_IF_FALSE / WIN_THROW
- dir: name not path
- merge test utilities from "lib" and "zSearch"

LATER ON:
- classes Exception (abstract?)
- Logging in Exception
- Logs require File and more advanced Dir functionality
- A better String class, that better manages UTF-8 paths and brings additional functionality?
- A "path" class, to better manage OS paths and encoding (UTF-16LE vs UTF-8)
