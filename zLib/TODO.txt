- download gmock & gtest at cmake step. or find a better alternative (problem building zLib separately)
- travis: disable. perhaps try setting jenkins on a linux vm.
- git submodules - is everything ok?
- rc files on windows - version
- ssh files on linux machine
- cpack / make install

- make DLLs
- build on linux
- in lib assert-s
- create directory of full path (not only name)
- create directory paths
- invalid paths + \\?\
- paths: change / to \\ or vice versa

- CMake files do not currently know about Windows or Linux files.
- #define THROW_IF_FALSE / WIN_THROW
- dir: name not path

LATER ON:
- classes Exception (abstract?)
- Logging in Exception
- Logs require File and more advanced Dir functionality
